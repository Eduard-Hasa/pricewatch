### REPL Interaction

## Developing

### Setup

- Run `./bin/setup`
- Edit `.env` and customize if necessary

### The REPL Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports web bin/dev
```

Then load the development namespace.

```clojure
user=> (dev)
:loaded
```

Run `go` to prep and initiate the system.

```clojure
dev=> (go)
:initiated
```

### Reloading Code in the REPL

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server. The code will be reloaded and the system
will be restarted.

```clojure
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:resumed
```

### Safely Stopping the REPL

It's best to explicitly stop the system before stopping the REPL else, it can
hang.

```clojure
dev=> (halt)
dev=> :repl/quit
```

If you quit and the process does hang then you can kill it with Docker in
another shell.

```sh
docker-compose kill web
```

### Testing

Testing is fastest through the REPL, as you avoid environment startup time.

```clojure
dev=> (test)
...
```

But you can also run tests through a standalone command:

```sh
docker-compose run --rm web bin/test
```
